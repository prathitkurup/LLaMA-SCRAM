Collaboration so far has been going well. This week I had a slight issue equally splitting up the work with Noah (my partner on the backend work). When addressing the code inspection feedback from our other team members we said I would work on the user tests and he would work on the registration tests. Instead Noah went in and addressed all of the feedback for both files before I could fix the user test file. We worked it out afterwards though so it's been resolved.,Positive,Positive & negative,0,Positive,Negative,0

Jace and Minghong are great teammates that get their work done early and are able to help with my work if I am struggling. Bryan and Sam have done zero work this week and did not communicate or check in until the day everything was due to let us know that it wasn't going to get done.

"I feel neutral about the way my team has collaboratively worked together because it appears that in the beginning of the lab iterations, me and another teammate tends to get through our parts of the lab pretty early while the others tend to push things to the last minute. There is good communication amongst everyone, but it seems like some members do not participate in the conversation as much.",Positive & negative,negative,0,Negative,Negative,1

Working good with a teammate in the sub team. Sharing information quickly.,Positive,Positive,1,Positive,Positive,1
"We're going to have to start working on the iterations earlier than we are. I started on my work on Monday, but some members began their work 2 days / the night before it was due. I have no doubt we'll finish on time, but I don't think such behavior will be sustainable for the implementation parts.",Negative,negative,1,Negative,Negative,1

He changed the design of the system and made it increasingly complex, and introduced bugs that made us take much longer to complete the project (I spent approx 7-8 hours debugging problems related to the changed system, that was not a task that I was responsible for.) In the end, we resorted to rewriting the entire lab to solve the issues. Completing this lab took far longer than it should have. ",Negative,Positive & negative,0,Negative,Negative,1

"My team's collaboration process this week was not as good as I expected it to be. I had been sick on Friday and now even today, I am still sick. As such, I wasn't able to check in properly to see the progress of the lab on Saturday and Sunday. On Friday, Tong and I went into a zoom meeting to discuss the structure of the class diagram and we believed we finished our design during the meeting, but later turned out that there were many errors that I made along the way, including not adding a controller for the Add Ingredient use case which also affected the method responsibilities of the API endpoints, which I had to fix by myself yesterday after coming to that conclusion. In addition, Tong and I also collaborated on the API endpoint design to work with use case 7 and we had the right ideas, but we did not realize that we were supposed to make a table specific for ingredients and instead added them as part of the inventory table, which I also fixed myself yesterday as well.  Alex was not in the meeting but he said he was busy when I asked for progress on Friday. On Monday, I asked Alex if he had completed his part with the sequence diagram, and to my absolute horror, he did not realize that the sequence diagram for the team deadline was due in 3 hours 45 minutes the moment he responded and he got to work on it right away. Previously, I had asked the team earlier Monday morning if there was anything that needed to get done, but I had gotten no response. Right before the deadline, this was when I realized that there were missing elements in the static diagram and that we needed a table for ingredients instead of adding new ingredients directly to the inventory table. However, after telling Tong about my revelation, he didn't seem to make any notable changes to the API documentation and left it mostly as is, either seeing as there was no problem with it or he didn’t see my message or he chose not to respond to the question that I posed to him on Discord, unaware of our mistake. If we did not have the table, then we would not have a sequence diagram that would utilize the IngredientService and IngredientRepository, which posed a big problem in our implementation. This was when I modified both our API endpoint documentation and the class diagram we currently had to include a controller for adding new ingredients to a table and to make our endpoints add new ingredients to the ingredient table. To Alex’s credit, he was very confused about how to create the sequence diagram since it relied on the idea of using an ingredient table and an Ingredient controller class, which can be partially attributed to me.  After fixing up the API endpoints documentation and the class diagram, Alex began to work on the sequence diagram and he did eventually finish, but he deliberately deviated from the standard process of pushing changes to GitHub, where he created a pull request and confirmed his own pull request, despite me telling him prior that I can confirm his pull request, losing us even more technical process points. He did this multiple times and even renamed the development branch to “aychen” at one point, causing me stress and making me believe that the development branch got deleted. Similarly, Tong also uploaded the image of the class diagram that I made to the main branch instead of a feature branch off of the development branch without my knowledge, likely losing technical process points for the team. Afterward, Alex was tasked to describe the scenario that the sequence diagram was depicting and why our implementation of an alternative ingredient would be successful.  Due to my lack of trust in Alex completing the task on time, I’ve decided to step in and write about the scenario and why the sequence diagram would show a successful implementation of the alternative ingredients beforehand, hoping that he may be able to come up with a better description than what I can provide. However, when it came time to write about the scenario, he decided to use my description of the scenario verbatim instead of writing up his own. Next, Alex had to write up our reasoning for our implementation. However, after trying to give the reasoning for our implementation, he said on Discord verbatim “I give up, can you do the ""Why this is successful"" part?” despite the fact that the task was his responsibility to complete and he started unreasonably late. I put my reasoning into the wiki and that concluded the team task. At this point, I had essentially completed the wiki page for the sequence diagram for him despite the fact that it was his responsibility to complete it in a timely manner and I had to complete it while I was still sick. The task was completed 2 days after the intended team deadline. I was also unable to check in on Discord due to illness. Overall, similar to milestone 1, milestone 2 had also been very disastrous in that a team member did not complete their entire task on time, and I had to redo portions of the class diagram and API endpoints to help complete the sequence diagram. In addition, my teammates struggle to understand how the team deliverables worked, costing us valuable points, and making collaboration as a team difficult to see in the future.  Unfortunately, I don’t see a good future in working with this team further to complete the OBP since there is a high likelihood that these same events (i.e. finishing a team task that should’ve been done a long time ago on the day of the team deadline) can take place again and on an even bigger scale such that the team task wouldn’t be completed on time, so I would like to formally request to join another team, specifically the team that I wanted to be on initially at the beginning of the semester with Ahmad Waleed (awaleed), Om Patel (oapatel2), and Garrett Curran (gtcurran). I wanted to work with these people because I know they will hold themselves accountable for their responsibilities and complete their work in a timely manner, as I have worked with them in the past and I know I can trust them. I really wanted to put my trust in my teammates, and I even tried to endure it for one more week as you asked me to, but it felt pointless since I’d practically done most of the work myself again. It seems no matter what, the result will always be the same. I am sorry, Dr. Heckman, but if I work with this team any longer, it is going to negatively impact both my grade and my mental health. I respectfully ask that you switch me out of my current team and add me to the team containing the aforementioned preferred teammates in my Google form submission (Ahmad Waleed (awaleed), Om Patel (oapatel2), and Garrett Curran (gtcurran)).

My implementation for APIIngredientController was not correct when she started which did cause trouble on her end, but I believe if she had notified us things weren't running earlier we would have refactored that class sooner. We also had some code in Inventory that the other teammate and I were planning to fix (to use Lists instead of Maps) after she pushed which was later than preferred. I understand other courses get in the way as well as personal responsibilities so I do not want to be too harsh on her. I strongly believe if you know if you cannot do a task well it is best to not claim it; leave it for others to do. Or at least do as much as you can early on to leave a big wiggle room to debug.

Sam also pushed code to main that resulted in a failed build and they did not wait for approval before merging. This resulted in me spending an unecessary amount of time fixing the team repo and will probably cost us points because I had to make changes directly in main.

Bryce I think does not have a clue about what is going on, and neither does Madilyn. Allison ended up doing okay this round, but her frontend left a lot to desire so I basically had to go and touch it up a ton. It has seemed like everyone else has been pulling me in to help them, so far to the point where I could not get my work done because I had to help with the frontend or explain stupid simple stuff to the team.

During our Zoom meeting, one of the members asked me to slow down so they could do some work, so I shifted to documenting instead of coding, but they still didn't start working for a while after.

We intended to split up the work 2 people on each use case, but Sara Sophia (ssmasood) and I worked together some, while the other two members of my group did nothing. This left me to implement both use cases. ",Negative,Positive & negative,0,Negative,Negative,1

"My team was able to collobate effectively by splitting up the team delivarable work into two-person tasks, and by setting a deadline to make sure we all got our work done by then or asked help from each other if we could not. ",Positive,Positive,1,Positive,Positive,1
"I feel Aaron really carried our team this week. Although I worked hard on editRecipe, the progress I was able to make in 6 hours was nothing compared to Aaron’s. He has worked with front end a lot and, because of the time crunch, we relied heavily on him to help pair program ",Positive,negative,0,Positive,Negative,0

"I am incredibly happy with how we were able to work as a team to complete the frontend implementation. I will say that Joey might have done a bit more than the rest of us, as we did not fully understand the difficulty of each task when breaking it up between us. Not knowing AngularJS myself, I still felt satisfied with the learning experience I had while implementing my portion, and I feel that it was a substantial portion of the team's technical deliverables.",Positive,Positive,1,Positive,Positive,1
